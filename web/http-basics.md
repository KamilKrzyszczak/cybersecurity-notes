# HTTP Basics for Web Security

## Why it exists
HTTP is the foundation of communication between clients and web applications.

## How it works
Client sends a request → server processes it → server returns a response.
HTTP is stateless by design.

## OSI Layer
Layer 7 – Application.

## Security relevance
Most web vulnerabilities exist because of improper handling of user input,
authentication, sessions, and headers.

## Tools / Commands
- Browser DevTools
- curl
- Burp Suite

## Key takeaways
Understanding HTTP is essential before using tools like Burp Suite
or learning OWASP Top 10.
